-1	Firstly I think we're gonna need to see some source for the page you're having problems with . Secondly have you tried a View source on the resulting page to see if there anything else in there ?
1	Is this happening in development only ? Is it possible that class reloading is the issue as classes are not cached in development if you are adding methods during execution the class could be reloaded without your newly defined methods ?
1	Are you packing boxes into box shaped bins ? Can you rotate boxes to make them fit ?
1	Following your edit it looks like your rescue is catching a SystemExit exception raised when you call exit rather than the TypeError from trying to join nil with a String . What on multi.rb  line 234 ?
1	Can you be more specific about how you want it to evaluate the logic ? What should the code output ?

-1	a name is all a user needs to be created ? no other validations ?
-1	Could you try re stating the question a little more clearly ? I'm not clear on how the comma grouped lists of connections in your path relates to the input graph G . For example D A appears twice does that mean there are two paths from D to A in the graph ?

-1	Ya Now I am understanding the problem . But what is the correct way ?
-1	Why do you need to compress it that way ? Do you need fast information retrieval once the data is compressed it is a question of memory ?
-1	I'm pretty sure there are lots of this kind of plugins out there that do the same thing . Why do you want to make yours ?
-1	Do you mean you only want the alternate caps inside of delimited portions of your string e.g . output should be hello HoW ArE YoU DoInG .
-1	Are those backticks surrounding the column names and table name ? Did you try the query with regular single quotes ?

1	Did you read the page linked to from that one ? If so which what part s didn't you understand ?
-1	Does the array contain negative numbers or only positive numbers ? Does it contain zeros ?
-1	Can you share some information about what does not work ? What are you expecting that to do ?

-1	And what is the question ? What is not working as you want it ?
-1	PHP is not made for long run . Why do you need it ?
-1	You created an object of class A . Why would a print_r in some instance of class B have access to something you changed in a different instance of class A ?
-1	What not actually working ? As in what the exact error you're getting ?

-1	It should be . What happens when you try it ?
-1	I find it odd you have to define both the height and the width for an image when your are displaying the image are you defining the width and height already ? eg . img src height y width x and have you tried using display none instead of the visibility property ?
1	Can you give a little more context ? What library contains this line of code ?

-1	You do SELECT FROM tablename WHERE id_products 13 AND name audio AND value 2.1  AND name hdd AND value 200 gb but that won't return anything because there is no row that has all these values . Are you looking for OR instead of AND ?
1	@Jakub Hampl At my current stage of design it is more of a logic based game rather than an animation driven game . Out of curiosity could you expand on the more powerful topic you were mentioning ?
1	agreed but i am not seeing the checkbox . are you able to wiki fy it ? thx
-1	That not how Shoulda worked when I tried it out . Care to show us some code ?
-1	Not my question but okay . Would you care to elaborate on this and tell me what exactly is wrong ?
1	Sure . Can you describe such a enumeration ? :)

-1	Do you really mean 128GB of ram ? Or 128MB ?
-1	How do you know it doesn't work ? What if you use an absolute path instead of a relative one ?
1	Does it need to follow a specific pattern ? Or is it fine if the characters from the input set appear potentially at any place ?
1	While this is obviously possible it is far from trivial if you want it to look decent . Can you maybe get away with having several pre rotated tower images and flip between those ?
-1	The data is dynamic for each particular user ? Or is it dynamic for a particular period of time but for all users during that time span ?
1	The character set in Oracle is WE8ISO8859P1 the eacute in my example is correctly stored in the database if I stay within Oracle but when I bring it into PHP via oci8 thats where the problem arises . Is there anything better than the charset_decode_utf_8 function ?
-1	I don't see you saying that you have measured the performance and found it lacking . Out of curiosity how much slower is the extra method call and what are you doing that is sensitive to this small slow down ?
-1	I find it strange that you call datetime.now  3 times but get different results look in the query one of the times is 00 00 00 and the other 2 are not . maybe you should assign the results of datetime.now  to some variable and pass that to the filters ?
-1	I think you need some more examples cause I still don't understand what you're trying to do . What about longer arrays and a different number of elements to select ?
1	Am I correct in thinking that you only are interested in paths having minimum edge count across all paths ? Ie if there exists a path with weights 2 2 2 you're not interested in the path 5 6 7 8 right ?
-1	write and format work in Perl 5 Why do you want need to change it ?
-1	OK so that works but out of interest why ? Why doesn't it store the number as 16.695 as was set ?
-1	You mean sample data such as for testing ? Or fuzzing ?

-1	What do you want to obtain from parsing ? An expression tree ?
-1	Homework ? Project Euler ?
-1	Why not just generate the autocompletion configuration based on your YAML file ? The options won't be changing all the time so why bother trying to make the autocompletion configuration dynamic ?
1	Just a basic question how many stacks of orders are we looking at ? Also how big are your sets 1000s of numbers millions of numbers or more ?
1	yes that should be possible . I'd have to build some UI based on some javascript library and then some custom php integration to save the preferences in drupal database then ?
-1	Laboriously went to the trouble of downloading XCode3 and IB and when I open the XIB the key paths are missing . Can XCode4 not properly save keypaths in NSPredicateEditorRowTemplates ?
1	Can you post your htaccess ? And which directory is it in ?
1	Given the screenshot is it possible you have JavaScript that interfering with the display of the form element value ? Or well CSS that renders the text invisible ?
1	Can you elaborate ? An example maybe ?
1	Usefulness and acceptable range of RMSE depends on the goal of the enhancement you are doing and the contents of the image . Can you tell a bit more about that ?
1	Im in Mac OSX so I guess it working as it supposed to . Is there a way to change this ?
-1	Any algorithm or algorithms in computational geometry ? Also is this homework ?
1	Also note that I know this question has been asked before and the general consensus was to avoid rebuilding your code if you didn't need to then you don't have to deal with the changed assemblies which apparently is a part of the deal . May I ask why you need to rebuilds to be identical as opposed to just not rebuilding it if the code hasn't changed ?
-1	You'll have to be much more specific . How are you escaping the text before entering it into the database ?
1	Oops this was meant to be on Stack Overflow . Can someone migrate it please ?
-1	Target platform is OS X @Bavarious What alternatives ?

-1	Have you copied your code here good or retyped it not good ? Is the error on the line where newIndex is declared assigned to ?
-1	Are you the same user as http stackoverflow.com users/872302/user872302 ? If not could you explain briefly why you have the same IP address and is posting similar questions ?
1	Please can you show the exact code that fails for example if this is in a view paste in the relevant part . Is it % sanitized_text truncate msword_text % that fails and % sanitized_text msword_text % that is okay ?
1	And an intelligent crop is a 3rd . Note though that the aspect ratios are different in the example 0.96 vs 1.1 so perhaps Andre means resizing first then cropping to match aspect ratio ?
1	Not sure I'm reading the question correctly . So each user books a cottage s 60 times a year ?
-1	@codeka 4 in all of those bases is still 4 . A more interesting question would be what base is 10 ? P

1	In what way does it fail ? ie what happens differently in your program between the first method and the second one ?
1	I'm not sure what the distinction is that you're making . What do you want to store and how do you want to retrieve it ?
-1	Can quotes be escaped ? If so how ?
-1	it just goes to update.php ? nothing after ?
1	Maybe you should give an example of the array too ? As I understand you want to delete entries from an array using only php no JS ?

1	I don't understand what you're asking . Can you give an example of what you mean or are trying to achieve ?
-1	A hash and a sort both require you to load the entire A.txt file into memory . Why do you think sorting is better than using a hash ?
-1	@Joonas What about the solution posted by Benjamin Manns ? That does not work for you ?
1	The code you've posted works fine for me . Are you doing something like get_simps get_simps 20 ?
1	It looks pretty good to me . Can you give some idea of why you think it incorrect ?
-1	Agreed . Can you tell at a higher level what you're trying to do ?
-1	I included a screenshot . Do u have any idea ?
1	My first impression is that it is indeed with the StackPanel since it default is to shrink around elements . Have you tried using a fixed size container and adjusting the width if needed as part of the animation ?
1	@user5402 could you please elaborate ? What does opening the pipe do ?
-1	But that just the same as where user_id 6 and food_id 2 and type 6 ie matching all three criteria so that no rows from your example will match . Are you sure that what you meant ?

-1	What do you mean by equivalent value Are you just looking for a linear function like that in @phimuemue answer ?
1	zc.buildout does something like this although I wouldn't want to try reading its source code . Have you tried asking on the distutils sig mailing list ?

-1	Are your images stored as binary or strings that are path to the files on disk ? Why don't you want to use a load of img tags wrapped in a tags ?
-1	You might want to re architect this if you are counting the number of files folders every minute you are creating a race condition . What about having each function update a counter or use a lockfile to ensure that the periodic process doesn't update the count until both functions have finished executing ?
-1	I suppose you don't have the chance to just set the right time zone on your server eg with dpkg reconfigure tzdata on a Debian machine ?

1	Oh ok i know exchanges LOVE multicast . Anyway are you trying to get a second machine to process the data for redundancy or for more throughput ?
-1	I don't quite understand the problem . If your code works won't it fire both when the browser is resized the first time and when the browser is size back to its original size ?
1	@Mike I would stick to what I have if this is better than what I am seeking . My thinking is if there was already an calculated number assigned I can use it because $ chk even and $ chk odd would be iterating through all rows twice correct ?
1	This is probably more of a timing issue than anything else . Can you provide some information as to the actual application of this to whatever you're doing ?
-1	The tweening part is easy you just do simple linear interpolation in the 3-dimensional color coordinate space . But it not clear what you want do you want the initial color on page load to reflect the age and then have the age continue to change slowly ?

1	I think if you were to consider the DAL as a seperate entity and imagine that it was your sole responsibility whilst all consumers was work done by a third party you would probably raise an exception for Access Denied most of the framework would .
