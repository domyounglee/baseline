-1	I just occurred to me yesterday while playing with the Bushnell 7x50 Marine binocs I got for my birthday that the url section on rangefinding reticles might be worth its own article if for no other reason than that rangefinding reticles are used on other optics such as said binoculars which have a compass and 5 milliradian graduated reticle and some other specialized items such as golf rangefinding monoculars which use the standardized height of the flag as the known size item . So what do you think is there enough content in the rangefinding section to make a standalone article and do I provide enough argument to justify pulling it out and adding links from url and url ?
-1	Hi Josiah I'm a touch concerned about the entry on Ian Levine bio about his comparison to the Abzorbaloff thing . Even if critics have speculated about it is this really needed on a biographical page ?
-1	This is just too confusing how can a team be an affiliate of the NHL team but not the AHL team ? Especially in a AA hockey league ?

-1	In general it isn't a great idea to block an IP address indefinitely although this one seems to be pretty static . Maybe reduce to 6 months rather than indefinite ?

1	I've finished with that category yes . Would you like a hand clearing it ?

1	I'm sorry but I don't see what you're talking about . Could you be more specific ?

1	Thank you for your answer . What are the sources for region 4 Australia release dates ?
-1	Either way administrators shouldn't be relying on counting how many categories are there for deletion even if I accept to create the category only one day in advance . Suppose the bot fails to create the category for a day then you'll see only five categories and do no deletions on that day ?

-1	Actually it IS quote mining when you provide a quote from an author that is the exact opposite of the primary meaning and intention of the author . Let me ask you then what was the primary message of the Linde letter to the editor ?
-1	It probably a bit late to be asking this but why did you dispute the factual accuracy of the page url ? Also why was no mention of the nature of the dispute made anywhere ?

1	Just a question about the maintenance categories that FemtoBot automatically creates each month I've noticed that the bot is frequently forced to recreate old long deleted monthly categories in the person queue because an article got reverted to an old version for one reason or another and resulted in the old category being temporarily repopulated again . I'm just putting this forward as an idea for discussion and am certainly not wedded to it u2014 but just to keep things simpler for everyone I wonder what you would think about the feasibility and or desirability of recoding the bot so that when it encounters a repopulated old maintenance category it would retag the article to the current month instead of recreating the old one ?
-1	The problem remains that I don't know where to turn to educate myself further on the matter . For instance where would I find the Tao Green paper you mention in the article ?

-1	Great . Any reason why SCIRS is still an essay and not a content guideline ?

-1	What about the whole Heroes as personal feifdom trip ? Or are you ok with that ?

-1	Which authorities are you referring to ? Can you give the name of a linguist grammarian who considers that removing the accents from a French Polish or Serbian person name creates an exonym ?
-1	Why did you rollback url ? It appears by a quick scan that the user was correct re url but regardless seemed a good faith edit one certainly not worthy of a vandalism rollback I would think ?
-1	Why the removal of the citation dealing with coriolis ? Was the proof not within the citation or was the citation not considered primary ?

1	I think I'll leave it to the Math WikiProject to decide whether the dab page should be at url or url since they'll be more familiar with the importance of the various functions . It looks like all of the basic options I was considering are basically OK from the perspective of the DAB project right ?
1	Out of curiosity what are you testing ? How are things going ?
-1	I see that KarBot is editing User Talk Pages . Is this deliberate ?
-1	You made three other edits to the url article on 25 November 2007 . Can you explain why ?
1	Thank you that clarifies matters . Has the image been listed for deletion on commons or should I do so ?
-1	Also I undid the recent move to Eris pending some discussion . Maybe you'd like to support oppose the move ?

-1	So I take it you live in Perth ? Have you ever been to Virginia ?

-1	I'm no expert on the language but on the face of it that dab page disambiguates two words which are unambiguous anyway Zakhmet and Khachpas . Am I missing something ?

1	Thanks for taking all that on just wondering on the template if that Vancouver North LM split vs Fraser Valley South LM split is something Elections BC cooked up North and South just don't seem right geographically compass wise it more like West and East I'm imagine there reason to your rhyme dito Vancouver Island South Coast which is a geographical somewhat if North Island is included the Queen Charlotte Strait region is part of the Central Coast . If those are divisions used by Elections BC I guess that what it is though I can make some additions to various pages describing the changes relating to ridings they're made out of and waht areas are in out in each case and since the districts were created in 2008 shouldn't hte title say that instead of 2009 ?
-1	You added to the Order of Victoria and Albert page that no awards were given out after the death of Queen Victoria . According to the url she became the tSovereign of the Order in 1952 . Is this just because the order was never officially scrapped ?

1	Stephen solution certainly isn't optimal . Fancy giving me a basic rundown on the problem here and I'll see if I can devise a more elegant one ?
1	Thanks for that very nicely commented code rare to see ! It seems to need a table to be set up do you have the schema or sql for that handy ?

-1	We already list Latvia Lithuania and Estonia separately . Along with Belarus and Ukraine that doesn't leave much of the USSR that was occupied does it ?
-1	Wikipedia has a strict rule about not simultaneously filing an article in both a parent category and a subcategory of the same parent . Could you please not add url to a category if it already in url url or a country specific record labels category ?

1	Hi Cmadler I've written a new ALT hook at the person that I think addresses your concerns . Could you sign off on the nomination ?

1	Congratulations OGoncho ! Isn't there a barnstar for things like that ?
1	I'm sorry I'm having trouble understanding your question . Could you try again ?
1	I like the image of the Finnish lighthouses . Do you know if it is for sale anywhere as a poster ?
-1	Unreliable websites should be avoided altogether as even their citations might be wrong . Do you see a specific problem with the AKC breed standard ?
-1	I was thinking about bringing that up . I wonder if this is the first time someone beat me to it ?
-1	I'm not trying to be obtuse but is what you're saying in essence that if we cannot tell whether an award is utterly trivial then that uncertainty becomes sufficient assertion of notability to not apply A7 ? So if an assumption needs to be made or discretion employed A7 doesn't apply because the assertion of notability has been made ?
1	It is disputed among admins regarding the protection of userpages although the policy says that users can have their user user sub pages but not the talks semi protected if the user requests it . Are there other subpages of yours that you'd like protecting ?
-1	I tried url and it worked for me . What articles did you try using it on ?
1	Sorry for the slow reply something I needed to take care of . url is restored if it is mentioned in such url could you please url them in the article ?
-1	After finally reaching some agreement not to declare what Christians believe about a controversial point why did you just revert the beginning of the article to make such a declaration ? Can we please drop the POV declaration ?
1	Hi SKS I saw your post on the discussion on the charts page about Billboard Korea and I clicked the link and the website seems to be up and running but I can't make sense of it . Can you have a look at it ?
-1	We can but that just a page revision . The file revisions containing the actual media are the ones you want no ?
-1	Yobot labelled url as a stub though it has person . Perhaps that a dab template Yobot doesn't know about ?
1	And after seeing this talk page I'll also note that there is no difference between scalars in math physics and computing those articles should all be merged together . Maybe you'd be interested in doing such a merge ?
1	Up to you I see myself picking off one or two every now and then but nowhere near the level of work NortyNort is doing now . By the way I have an open CCI request that I want a second opinion on could you please help ?
1	Hi Dirk . Does the two books you cited for the heavy Belgian url losses have any info of how many Gladiators the Belgians lost and perhaps what losses they incurred on the Germans ?
1	Hi Schutz it still busted . Would it be OK with you if I asked GimmeBot to take over the mainpage bolding ?
-1	Where is the source that Sotero was non practicing Muslim ? Doesn't going to mosque to prayer constitute practicing ?
1	I don't have the full list online but I do have the 07-08 AJHL record book . Are there any specific seasons or teams you are looking for ?
1	Thank you for your Wikignome like edits . What do you think substantively ?
1	I'm in Japan timezone and at work now and most IRC is totally blocked through work proxies . Can we do a weekend ?
-1	What was your aim with url ? have you abandoned it ?
1	Nice work that explains it quite clearly ! Any idea who came up with the scheme ?
1	You may want to comment on the A7 to 2 graph with 4 lines . I suspect it is nonsense but what are your thoughts on that folding option ?
1	This is great so far ! What do you feel you need help with ?
1	Are these two more articles that should be moved on January 1st ? Did you get my email about admin nomination for you ?
1	I got the page fixed . Sorry I had to do it several times on the page but it wouldn't let me revert it to before the IP user vandalized it how do you do that ?
-1	Also it strikes me that the url need a map . How did you go about getting your Chew Valley map done ?
-1	You lost me J . I did the edits because I remember you telling me that repeating things that are already in the wiki link is unneeded and or redundant . Do you not recall that instance ?
1	I recently was approved for VandalProof and I installed everything and stuff but I'm confused on how it is actually run like what do I click to start it . Could you please help me a little ?
-1	I'm a whole hearted believer in AGF but I also feel like I have a good nose for BS ... If what they said was true and it showed me what HE added in 1 box and what I added in another box  then the edits they made would also have appeared in the edit log by another editor right before them right ?
1	I would like to nominate you for adminship . Would you accept now ?
1	I have always maintained a control of the military section and I can check up the names in the educational section . Which section would you like to clean up ?
1	Sorry I understand the bot has just moved the category of the sub cat not merged it . Is the bot going to proceed to the next layer or does that have to be done manually ?
-1	It would seem to me that this category provides no overall benefit to wiki and only serves as another list of organizations which seem to be targeted by the generally negative tone of LGAT articles . Would it make more sense or be more proper to include the relevant categories on the individual articles themselves rather than have an LGAT category ?
-1	Thank you for fixing your edit . But why did you make it in the first place ?
1	Yes I can . Is it an alternate account ?
1	Thank you for the response on my user page . Would you be willing to add a few words to the FAC candidacy ?
-1	By the way the list schools was in wikimedia code . Or is there another way it should be done ?
-1	This may just mean that I'm willing to expand my view of the word ancestor arbitrarily far although finding a ribosome like organism sans nucleic acids and a replicating RNA like organism sans proteins would probably break it . On the other hand it'd be really cool and help explain abiogensis so who'd really care ?
-1	Alright RFC time . Can we meet on IRC ?
1	The link you provided to speedy delection criteria only goes up to CSD12 and there is no CSD 13 listed there . Could you clarify ?
-1	Did you read the census appendix that I have provided ? It itself says not to trust it ?
1	Dan can you take a look at the last exchange regarding the 1952 election ? Looking at the citations is there doubt in your mind that there was a deal or at least that it has been widely suggested by reliable sources that there was a deal ?
1	Since this person made a sincere attempt to discuss the page and the page in his opinion was relevent you can remove this warning from his talk page ? In the spirit of url perhaps ?
-1	I suppose that there is nothing to be done about it but Jamesd1 just buried a direct question to him about compromise under a long discussion about Alice Bailey supposed religious views Bailey was not a Christian that belong on a Bailey discussion forum not on this article talk page . Does not Wikipedia have some way to resolve editing situations in which editors refuse to compromise and end the arguing ?
1	Thanks firstly for the affirmation and work on url it was yesterday featured article ! As a related article I've been working on url what do you think would be necessary to get it to FA ?
1	I made a change to your user page . Is that the change you wanted ?
-1	url ? Do the guidelines disapprove of these kinds of dabs ?
1	Hi there I've raised the possibility of unprotecting the tamazepam page url . What are your thoughts ?
-1	Given the comments url saying that Ganglia also should be added to the bypass list and the fact that there are about 10 WMF projects wouldn't it be more effective if there was only a whitelist for adding the WMF projects which all have a secure version such as Wikipedia Wikiversity Wikinews Wiktionary etc Or would there be some drawbacks in doing this ?
-1	The sources are ref'd in the article . Can you be more specific ?
1	Hey thanks for reassessing the url article to B class . So what need to be done to make it GA ?
1	I noticed that for users warned before Huggle still uses level 1 warning . Is there anything I can do ?
-1	kindly explain why did you remove my changes . The added links were quite relevant and informational also The Vanguard Group and Hi5 why do you revert my edits ?
-1	You're welcome to revert edits but I'm puzzled as to why you reverted this one it seems absolutely essential to me the give a summary of Genesis 1 . And if you revert Gen1 why leave Gen2 ?
1	Hi there I've found some peer reviewed publications that discuss Hoser work . Could you take another look at the article and the AfD discussion ?
1	Yeah I'd be happy to look at the list however can't promise much ! Shall we discuss it on the article talk page so that any comments are in the relevent place ?
-1	I'm not seeing it . Has it been fixed ?
-1	I am not involved at all i any governmental or anti drug organization or any pro or anti drug organization of any kind . If you don't have any claims on the sources what is then not in line with Wikipedeia policy in the article ?
-1	Ok that seems acceptable . Did I remove something like that ?
1	url is based at 340 Laurier Avenue West Ottawa Ontario K1A 0P9 It doesn't have a photo posted yet . Is this convenient for you ?
-1	Why did you remove you comment on the talk page ? Did you change your opinion ?
1	On reflection it up for GA peer review preparatory to trying for FAC . Would you care to url ?
1	True . What do you think about the notability of this particular article ?
-1	While you are absolutely free to vote however you choose FAC requires you lodge actionable objections and your objection as it stands right now is quite vague . Could you please specify it so I can take action and possibly reverse your vote ?
1	Please take a look at Space Shuttle Discovery for FPC . Will you reconsider ?
1	Hi Johnuniq thank you for your edit . Does the file should be deleted removed from commons then ?
1	I have put another warning on url with full details of the vandalism . Can this be reported to London Grid please ?
1	I will understand if you decline but would very much like you to accept . May I nominate you ?
1	Thanks for your comment . What was done wrong in listing the image for deletion ?
-1	if i send email to permissions en@wikimedia.org is the email made public ? where is it made public ?
-1	OK I retract this completely the IP hopper in question should well I'm biting my tongue . Have you reported them for vandalism with their half a dozen IP addresses ?
1	Thanks the logo looks much better now . You wouldn't have a logo for the two predessesor clubs by any chance ?
-1	I very much disagree that the article that was deleted was advertising I have never bought anything from his store as a matter of fact but I do know that his is one of the most used online Judaica shops out there . What can I do to make the article acceptable ?
1	I do understand the bot was approved and is doing useful job but . Is it possible to modify it to not save the changes if it is only one two whitespace s ?
-1	I don't follow . Can you address the above with regard to why it shouldn't be speedily deleted as a recreation of deleted material and as a content fork ?
1	I read your publication and enjoyed seeing the relationship between activeness and chance of success to become an admin . Are you planning to do a similar model for bureaucrats ?
-1	So you are still sidestepping the question . Please answer it directly please answer my question clearly are you saying is that you cannot use the wiki to edit cooperatively with other people on the same text or are you saying that you can use the wiki as it was intended and edit a single text cooperatively ?
1	I enjoyed your comments on the Road to Serfdom article . I wonder if you know if anyone has offered a reading of the book as a satire of the bourgeois administrative pseudo capitalist state ?
-1	Just in case you didn't know url has been blocked for being a url of url also blocked . Shouldn't their nonsense be cleaned up ?
-1	I'm getting a little nervous that the FAC not attracting much attention . You know FAC much better than I do should I be worried yet ?
-1	I went through your comments . How does it look now ?
1	Thank you for caring re my loss . We go on because it all we can ever do y'know ?
-1	Hi just returned from a longer vacation where I was 100% offline and can look at it soon if it is not too late . What is the deadline ?
-1	Sorry no clue . The help desk wasn't helpful huh ?
1	How about saying that the fastest flow is near the deepest part of the channel and that in most meanders this is near the outer bank ? What do you think ?
1	Hey what do you think if instead of naming surahs like this url we add the surah number to each like Surah 1 Al Fatiha . Would u agree with such page moves ?
-1	I bow to your superior knowledge of Irish One question the Irish Wikipedia is called Vikipedia ? How so there no v in the Irish alphabet ?
-1	The above templated message explains pretty clearly why the image was deleted . Do you have any specific questions about this image or our policy on replaceable non free content ?
1	I aggree river name then River . Do you think that since it a list of rivers in China we should use the Chinese name and the international norm name too ?
-1	Working on it sent an email to the people at the Cambridge U Library to see if they know where it from . In the meantime could you check with Jappalang that his concern about the infobox image has been addressed ?
1	I appreciate your effort to seek consensus through a merge proposal before merging url to url but as you are no doubt aware no one participated in the discussion meaning that while there was no articulated consensus against it there was also no consensus for it . May I recommend undoing the merge for now re opening the discussion and seeking wider input at the relatively large number of WikiProjects that handle those articles ?
-1	just wondering how the chapters were going . you think they are notable enough to have their own article ?
-1	clear about when the inverse exists . Is there a formal theorem that would apply ?
-1	Was working so no . You ?
-1	Why was url deleted when it was simply a crop of url which is public domain ? I'm pretty sure I wrote that on the description page but if not can it be restored ?
-1	Somehow we appear to be the only administrators updating the queues on DYK and I'm still learning at this . How can we make the process more efficient better ?
-1	So the nomination was made by your sock . Could you explain why you choose to use a sock ?
1	Ok Thank you for clarifying . Could you be more specific as to what you are specifying as the claim so that I may find relevant information to refute ?
1	The reason for the malfunctioning redirects is that the character immediately after REDIRECT is not an ordinary space but a non breaking space hex code 0xA0 . Out of curiosity how did you manage to create them ?
1	Yep she told me . How are you doing ?
-1	You just built an article called Fort Fort Mitchel . Did you mean to have two fort in the title ?
-1	What is your source for the PD Seantors ? There is no news on RTE ireland.com or the PD website ?
-1	He now been asked if he is the Alex Salmond and if not he should make that known . Imagine if he was ?
-1	Shouldn't url have 2010 as his final year ? It pretty late into 2011 to be getting fired but as I understand it his navbox should read 2010 and then whatever coach takes the lead for this season will be the interim no ?
-1	I think I do mark my pages patrolled . Doesn't Twinkle do it automatically ?
-1	I have a question for you . How do you deal with an editor who soul mission is to undo ALL url across a vast number of articles ?
1	Your url is a brilliant idea ! Would you mind if I linked to it from my collection of Useful things on my user page ?
1	I'm trying to install Lupin Anti vandal tool but im stuck . Could you help please ?
-1	url and url are both accounts which have vandalised the article and both have been created solely for vandalism . I believe they're one and the same do you know an admin that can take action ?
-1	I created this for you . However as a registered user do you know you can create categories by yourself ?
1	Excellent thanks ! I wonder if it worth temporarily uploading a cropped image for the main page as 100x100 is really very small ?
1	I'd be shocked if no one has asked you this yet but you do an enormous amount of work keeping the bio articles free of vandalism and nonsense as well as filling them up with useful content ;) You seem like you could use a few extra buttons on your toolbar . Are you interested in being nominated for adminship ?
-1	Sometimes one sees Sonata a 3 but sometimes with an accent grave as Sonata xe0 3 etc or either apparently indiscriminately in the various permutations of this form Canon a 2 Fuga a 4 and so forth . Is one or the other correct or does it depend on the original language for instance Italian vs German ?
-1	If I were to find information on the typical age of instance for hyperparthyroism OFC what section would that fall under ? Epidemology ?
-1	Take a look at the most recent post to url . Can you make a stub out of it ?
-1	It states on the page that it features her they sample the song and were going to try and get her to take part in the video Surely this counts as being featured on the single ?
1	I was just now leaving a note on Ruhrfisch talk page and noticed that you'd left a note there . I wrote about the url the other day the first time that I've ever created an NRHP article would you be willing to check it and to add to the infobox if there something that can easily be added ?
1	I saw on the status page that you have a free spot . Would you be able to coach me ?
-1	I was wondering why within your first few edits you could participate in AfDs and RfCs and welcome yourself . Are you a quick learner or had you been editing anonymously for a while ?
1	This is helpful for automatized transfer scripts . By the way did I get the location tag right on url ?
-1	The article now contains material about the crest . Are there any other reasons for your opposition ?
-1	What are the numbers url ? Are they population figures ?
-1	Of that url I just went down and overhauled you and two url url were the only active Texans I could imagine being interested in getting the ball for a url rolling . Interested ?
-1	I don't see that it is necessarily bigoted to dislike certain forms of behaviour after all there is a group of people who practice racist behaviour . Is it bigoted to dislike them ?
1	I'm really very sorry but no I didn't know didn't get a message saying that was wrong . Where was it ?
1	My question is Why  I am doing all the citations correctly and this still appears often . Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong ?
1	I see the dilemma with separate series in the case with untranslated Spirou there are no such problems but it seems to make more sense with no english publication to switch the brackets for english and original titles ex url . Does this create a problem with continuity ?
-1	Deletion requires some care an administrator has to check that the prod tag has been on the article for 5 day continously that the prod'ed version was not the result of vandalism that the prod reason is acceptable possibly checking the talk page then has to delete the article reporting this reason possibly deleting the talk page and finally checking the incoming links . Before starting doing this on every article in the category this adimin relies on the number of categories instead of calculating five days to today ?
-1	4 Are there any signed agreement with the Anglican Church in this regard ?
1	Your reasoning is very sound it would appear that USGS is wrong and I have no problem with changing it back . In general what are your thoughts on using the GNIS database for park coordinates elevations as we convert to the Geobox ?
1	By the way Do you know how to remove the spaces created below the project banner when others are placed below it ? And how to make capitalisation of the rating not matter ?
-1	I reverted url as it complicated my normal routine archiving of all the discussions on my talk page . Could you please refrain from this kind of edit in future ?
1	Arguably listing the former constructors and even the template itself is not necessary . Could we please try reinstating the previous version and see if and how many other folk don't find the decade information useful intriguing ?
-1	But if you change something for your entertainment if no one catches that it will misinform someone else . What if you go to Wikipedia to learn something but someone has put in false information ?
1	I think I lot of the things on the Methuselah page are very interesting but perhaps should be transferred to the Biblical Generations article if they touch on more than just Methuselah . Would you agree ?
1	I was thinking about creating a page about Nintendo eShop . And since you are a well trusted user I am asking you if you think that would just be deleted because there isn't enough information ?
-1	Thanks . Is Brazil4Linux doing anything particully bad right now ?
-1	All those people have said to news sources they aren't running are or something related ? Or am I confused ?
1	I think the article needs work . For example I think US late 1980s 1990s should after Detroit sound  UK 1990s should after US late 1980s 1990s  What do you think ?
-1	Eh thanks Sometimes impressing is too easy . Do you want to review the windmill article above ?
1	style vertical align middle padding 3px I've started the Badfinger wiki amd I need help . You seem to know a lot about them could you please help out ?
1	I'm not finding the name change request at url nor does there appear to be such an edit under the Rogerboas account name . Did you posti t while logged out perhaps ?
-1	Wait what the COI Was this on the fringe noticeboards ?
-1	Hi I'm confused . I seem to have lost the note that you say I left on your page ?
1	I would be willing to move this article to the incubator so that it can be worked on I agree it wouldn't be an A7 today though if it to be made into a real article it needs to be done with someone with no conflict of interest regarding the subject as creating articles for things you own is highly discouraged . If I undelete it to the incubator would you agree to let it go and leave it up to other users without a conflict of interest ?
1	Thanks . As an aside since this did turn out to be factual just very hard to source do you think the community would countenance an unblock request from Blaabla if he accepted some strict unblock conditions such as packing in the systemic bias thing discussing his edits in a less confrontational manner etc ?
1	I noticed that you are the major contributor to the articles . Mind if I nominate url at url ?
-1	I haven't received an answer but it wasn't reverted . What does this mean ?
1	You are right I apologize not doing so . A different layout for the template could be interesting perhaps even with names or those delivered in person by text but I didn't quite see the logic in the way you had broken up the dates by 20 year blocks interspaced with 4 year blocks right ?
1	I actually posted my comments a couple minutes ago . Do you think that explanation works or do you think it a good idea I elaborate further ?
-1	Well if Mattisse has caused me to CU innocent editors then it time for her to be blocked from editing her own talk page . MC do you think I should withdraw the CU or let it ride ?
1	Hi there . On a tangential note would you happen to be person ?
1	Thanks for your help on this it much appreciated . Should I delete my request for checkuser ?
1	Ok that no problem . Can you recommend any other users who would be able to train me ?
-1	There is current discussion pertaining to this at the Women History project page url . Would you mind not templating BLPs until a consensus has been reached ?
-1	So you haven't found a flaw in any of their ideas themselves ? As regards your other comment are you saying that all Muslims are equally capable of finding out the truth about Islam ?
1	Hi I can run a newsletter bot for you WesleyDodds . Whatcha need me to deliver ?
1	Hi Eugene long ago you made a dump of missing articles at url . Are you able to produce a new dump like this as it needs a refresh otherwise can you point me to how it is done ?
1	You were right that there was a problem but I see Xn4 has now had a go at it . Perhaps you could look at it again ?
-1	I will take out Haskett in deference to you . OK ?
1	I'm pretty sure there already is a filter possibly more than one for this . What page got moved ?
-1	The template I want is the one that goes at the bottom of the article and produces a message that goes something like This article is a copy of the X article in the German wikipedia version 21 December 2009 10 04  What is that template ?
-1	The anon is clearly in violation of the three revert rule . Do you know where this can be reported ?
-1	Hello Um are you looking for me to do something about that BRFA or actually write a bot to perform that task ?
1	Good luck on your url . What time is url url ?
-1	Also what the point on being adopted by another user ? It sounds good and I'd like to be adopted though I'd don't exactly know what I or the adopter would get out of it ?
-1	I saw your motorcycle map for Daytona . Could you do one for Indianapolis ?
1	Thanks ! There is yet another at url would you agree it should be closed the same as the others ?
1	Let me know when convenient and I'll put the kettle on . Tea or coffee ?
1	I never programmed that up because there were so few portal reviews far fewer even than portal candidates . How often does this happen ?
1	In the ACR for url you mentioned that you had concerns with my writing style and were wary of supporting it . Can you specifically clarify what content in the article you had grammatical concerns with so I can make the needed improvements and gain your support ?
-1	I couldn't find your source . How is Ye related to or different from Dongye ?
1	That a good idea . What about army and corps HQs though ?
1	On the mediation page you made a number of statements that I said I would like to discuss with you . Would you be willing to do that url ?
-1	You created url there is already a page that similar url . Why don't you mix 2 articles together ?
-1	Ta can tell its cold here I thought I was putting the message on your talk page and then realised it was indons and the similar spurious etymology and anecdotal rubbish is at ratu bokos palace as well had found a brilliant article on ratu boko in BKI but mislaid it anmd havent gone back . There is a means by where well documented folklore can stay on an article page if the editor knows of the correct texts to qoute re folklore and spurious etymology or geneology in java but if there is no acknowledgement of the academic citable ways of exlaining I say that such addons are ad hoc and worth the chop and message to user this is an encyc watcha think ?
-1	Actually meant this to go up under Cunard comment above but the new love heart thingumyjig doesn't have that subtlety . See these new wikilove templates are pretty nifty atren't they ?
-1	He clearly beyond the pale of Wikiquette farther than nearly anything I've seen what with this AFD thing and the claim that you and Mkdw blanked the talkpage and so on see my latest on url which ironically enough I posted just before he began his latest onslaught the US edition of Entertainment Tonight used HN tonight to refer to Sundance without mentioning the Canadian context at that festival which of course the Canadian edition which follows it did but I could only chuckle because the Hollywood machine behind Entertainment Tonight or that show writers anyway seem to use the term to mean anywhere in the cold not even north of the border anyway seems to me that Yellowsnow needs a big spanking but which area of url is the right one to use ?
1	I don't follow you I was not aware that my edits were vandalism I was editing according to what had it appeared to me been agreed on the talk page but additional material had been inserted that had not been agreed upon that esentialy said the same thing and was not supported by the sources that had caused the origioanl disagrement . I think I may have mis understood you point are you saying that I can only revert three times if its vandalism or that my edits were vandalims ?
1	I'm afraid I don't understand what you are asking . Could you perhaps try to explain it in another way ?
1	I was actually going to work on your suggestions today regarding the GA nomination for url . Do you mind reopening the nomination ?
1	Hey thanks for joining ! Have any ideas you wish to add to the project ?
-1	How does it feel being wikifamous ??
-1	What has this got to do with the article ? Is this in the right place ?
1	Hi I think that you do a fantastic job on DELSORT . However I was just wondering if when you add to Schools whether you would be good enough to add them to the appropriate section please ?
-1	I found url which we don't have on en wiki . Know anyone to do a proper translation ?
-1	what do you think was the purpose of this Fesselballon ? if it wasn't military what was the point in shooting it down ?
1	You recently attached a nowiki person nowiki tag to an article about an Azeri poet . May I ask why ?
-1	The article might assert that the subject is notable but the references are too weak to back up that assertion . Can I proceed with a prod or AfD ?
-1	Creating and improving images or just placing them in articles making sure they have the right copyrights etc .?
-1	So it not a copyright problem but it still needs to be made clear that the text is copied from the source per url . Is there a corresponding template for Collier similar to person where you're not just using it as a reference ?
1	Thanks for the ce on Attachment therapy . Are you kindly undertaking the second opinion ?
-1	COI it does not say you are not allowed editing article but pls answer questions so other editors know it is not usual to me an editor spends much time to put trivia in articles of relative biographies and compare David Sheffield Bell w Sigmund Freud ??
-1	Yes I do have the Family Guy DVD collection Volume 1 Seasons 1 2 . What up ?
-1	Hi noticed you removed categories on defunct renamed schools . Why do you think them unnecessary ?
1	Hey I saw that you're using Huggle and wanted to try it out too . I downloaded it but every time I try to open the program I get the message CLR error 80004005 . The program will now terminate What can I do to fix the problem ?
1	Sure How could I have missed that ?
1	I have just put the article to peer review . Would you care to take a look ?
-1	I don't know the only thing I can think of is that I changed his name to Psycho Derek for Wikipedia CommonName purposes . Or he in guest stars ?
-1	Who is going to contact all of the users ? Is a bot being set to do that in the event it necessary or is it being done manually ?
1	Hey I just noticed that you are NOT an administator I had always assumed that you were . I wondered if you would be interested in being nominated ?
1	I'm also having to use your link . Perhaps we should change the main page link to use the megaupload until we know that the main website is up ?
1	Well lyrics are generally frowned upon on Wikipedia unless the song is old enough that its copyright no longer applies . Could you perhaps link to the article ?
-1	Hi what does this mean if I am to be a named party in the case I at least need ot understand what it is about please explain Feuding and BLPs a case to examine meta behavioral issues and reconcile the applicable principles what do you perceive this is related to ?
-1	Claro mi madre es de El Salvador y tabien usan el vos . Cuales son los articulos que mas te interesan a vos ?
1	Just looking at that photo and the one in the article makes me feel cold :) . I just finished this article url a week or so ago and wonder if those Forward Operating Locations are tied into intercepts from those NORAD radar sites ?
-1	ok it not something I can get terribly excited about to be honest . Perhaps I am missing something ?
1	Thanks Anon . Better now ?
1	Hello thank you for adding interesting content to url url . Are you able to provide url that will help the content meet our url standard ?
-1	Basta colla tua grecofilia tendenzionista ! Ai capito bene ?
-1	That is the standard ARBMAC Arbitration related to some Macedonian and other Balkan countries warning . Still interested in accepting the deal ?
1	Anytime . How do you like this closer crop ?
1	Well welcome and thanks for helping out as you can see it greatly needed . Do you have url yet ?
1	Thanks very much for your edit to the url article . Would you be interested in tackling the url of url ?
