1	Hi Pete The user Darmi on url says that footnotes are used on Wikisource and he has two pages to show for it . What do you think ?
1	The Birr page looks good now but it seems a little strange to make a distinction between Abyssinia and Ethiopia as if they were two different entities . The native name was ityoppya Ethiopia long before 1931 in that year the Emperor formally requested the international community to begin using Ethiopia instead of Abyssinia much as the Shah around the same time requested the use of Iran instead of Persia for his country and it was also around this time that Siam became Thailand I believe Anyway it might make more sense for one box reading Abyssinia Ethiopia in place of the two separate boxes ...?

1	Thank you for the rollback . Does it appear in url or only in the history ?

1	I should be able to get that Mayr paper it on Wiley . Do you need me to email it to you ?

1	Thanks for change to Hugh de Grandmesnil I am It is very short of refs for that article . Could you suggest one for your addition ?
1	Sounds like a great idea . Do you want to propose it at the project talk page ?

1	Thanks for your input . Would you mind voicing your opinion in the GMC talk page ?
1	Doing it under the guidance of the relevant url would be a good idea as the folks that are active in the project will be best placed to advise on which templates and styles fit in with the rest of the project . What is the page subject you are working on ?
1	ok that was really confusing I clicked on this link url and then cleaned the page but the page still exists sso from what I understood if you put the ending double redirect at the end of any article you'll see how many redirects it has is that right ?
1	Hi I wsa just noticing that in url players such as Tommy Walsh and Paul O'Connor have appeared under T and P respectively rather than W and O . How should that be fixed ?

1	Hi I see you voted support but in the neutral section . Would you like to move that to the support section ?
1	Oh I can explain how for you . Do you have a url computer ?
1	Well the only plausible explanation was that you reverted to where I removed an extraneous cat after Homestarmy edit and then swapped out a template but as you're a competent editor that just seemed odd . Is that what indeed occurred ?
1	Looking at my various edit summaries to url I don't see any where I mentioned anything about another example . Can you say which edit you have in mind ?

1	This is a great way to deal with external links . Wondering if we should look at applying it almost universally for medical pages ?
1	Could you take a look at the article now and see whether your concerns except the reorganization have been addressed ? If not what is still missing and what technical terms do you feel need explaining ?
1	Thanks for pointing out a problem with the image licensing I must admit despite being a seasoned contributor I find this image licensing stuff pretty confusing and hard to get right are there recommended examples of standard things like book covers album covers paintings etc Have I done the Jonah cover ok now or not ?
1	Thanks ! To be absolutely fair his earlier edits to Rumble Fighter seemed serious maybe he left the pc untended ?
1	Thanks for the revert on url . Kinda curious how this blanking is always done by IPs that trace back to USAF installations isn't it ?
1	I have proposed the merge for you at these pages url url . Is that what you wanted ?

1	Hi Gareth . I was wondering if you could point me in the right direction for learning about building a wikipedia profile ?
1	I noticed that you did some work on this article and would like to expand it to include his recommendation in Can Life Prevail that the UN develop hit squads to target large urban population centers with neutron bombs as I recall and also the discussion on the 9/11 terrorists being superior moral human beings for their actions . Understanding that this is a BLP that NPOV is important and that including secondary sources is nearly impossible as they are difficult at best to find what is your feeling on this ?
1	Hello . Since you have contributed to url in the past could you spare a minute to discuss the fate of url ?
1	Im sorry to see that you withdrew . Maybe next time ?
1	Do you know how to make the All Star Template appear only at the bottom as well as the Confirmed future sites so the actual table appears at the top of the page ??
1	I just thought that it is nice when you are looking for RQ that you can find an algorithm that will do RQ not QR . It fine if we just make a section about RQ in the QR article is that ok with you ?
1	No problem . :) Did you see the additional notes on the project talk page about the rest of those books from the 70s ?
1	Sorry to not reply earlier regarding Deathrockeru2014I ve been away . Has the situation calmed ?
1	Slightly more seriously there a discussion over at url about the lack of non European info regards torture . Any chance that in your manifold research on all things psychohistorical you've found something that could be used to expand the section ?
1	I've tweaked it further It now accurate to within my ability to describe a complicated subject but rather too complicated . Can we simplify it without losing precision or alternately put something before the precise definition that a bit easier to understand ?
1	Marhaba Tiamut . url has grown quite a bit since last week and we're planning to take it to GA would you be interested in joining the push ?
1	Thanks ! What type of documentation do you want u2014 an explanation of using the notes feature ?

1	I'm not familiar with that article . Can you please specify the exact article title ?
1	On the WP Football discussion you mentioned that Man City had 150,000+ views more than the seasons article . Please could you tell me where I can find page views for wiki articles ?
1	person is apparently caught up in that rangeblock . Can you help him out ?
1	Sure . I have to warn you though the file size advantage has pretty much been lost since SVG font rendering went the way of the dinosaurs :) Do you make a point of having the border or can I leave it out ?
1	Hi thanks for your help . There is also this sentence Asukkaista 84,5% oli ruotsinkielisixe4 ja 15,4% suomenkielisixe4 vuonna 1970 ja kunta oli kaksikielinen  What does it mean please ?
1	Mel is the above comment from you ? If not could you please respond ?
1	Thanks . BTW there aren't any others that I've missed are there ?
1	No problem . Have you heard anything new about HRE ?

1	Hi . I stumbled upon your user page and was wondering if you could offer any tips for creating locator maps where do you get the base map and what program do you use to fill in the colours ?

1	Instead of deletion I'm considering simply redirecting Ponystars to url . Any objections ?
1	Thanks for improving the article . Can you add categories also ?
1	Thanks it just occurred to me to cite USGS maps but this is maybe even better . Was there once an airplane crash in the vicinity or are there maps like this for all parts of the country ?
1	Nice photo ! Could you help answer a question url at the Reference Desk related to the picture ?
1	I think if we did it that way it would add a lot of possibilities to the page enabling us to give breakdowns of other wars and major events in separate tables as well in addition to alternative listings which I think would be quite useful . Because there are a lot of events with different aspects to them that could be covered in more detail IMO what do you think ?
1	I'd like to try it out at FAC after Friday . Would you be willing to co nom ?
1	Yes Need help ?
1	Thanks for your reply . So just to clarify then you are happy with the number of references but you just need me to convert each of them into ref footnote format and then the article is GA ready is that correct ?
1	Sorry I was wondering if the are related to each other or separate organizations ? Also is there a difference between North Twillingate and Twillingate ?
1	I don't recall any consensus on that unilateral change . Can you direct me to it please ?
1	It already look great . BTW what are your thoughts about the previous post on the names of the other post office and rates lists ?
1	I would say you went a few steps further than I did ! Does make it easier to find yourself on the page doesn't it ?
1	Done . I may have missed a few links when copying them across so could you please look through it just in case ?
1	its it its Sheesh ! Thanks for fixing Scary huh ?
1	Hi hopefully I will have the url wonderful joy of a job task done by tomorrow so will be able to join you with the infobox adding task thereafter . Do you have a method or is it just A ndash Z ?
1	Presumably the CfD will be inconclusive . Given the technical issues perhaps an RfC might be more helpful ?
1	In short based on the sparse information provided by outsiders I would like to work constructively with you and others to whip the article into shape as its presence seems warranted but the article is unlikely to garner necessary details from random contributors . What shall I do next ?
1	Good catch . Do we have a solution for that yet ?
1	In the url article is polar mount correct ? It might be improved by a bit more detail about how it works perhaps ?
1	Just letting you know since you have mentioned AFDing url that weu2019ve gone to some effort to establish notability with url and have added three reliable notable third party sources to the article . Do you feel these sources establish url as being notable url and all that ?
1	xD if you say so ! By the way what your favorite game ever ?

1	Thank you for closing out this debate . Can you please restore the history for GFDL purposes ?
1	To be honest I'm not sure the decision say remove individuals and organizations but it also said per BLP and Abascal is deceased . Perhaps you should ask Timrollpickering the admin who closed the discussion to clarify ?
1	It may very well have been a better candidate for a stub rather than a speedy deletion . I would rather not talk about this on another users talk page if you would like to discuss if further could we continue any further posts on url ?
1	Many thanks . I can't resolve The work represents a summary of themes explored in Bacon previous paintings Tony right its clunky and unclear any ideas ?
1	Can it be expanded beyond a definition ? Can you write something about who coined it references to its usage in popular culture things of those sorts ?
1	A challenge for you ! What do you think about creating a template for convoys and a list of convoys ?
1	Thanks for the infomative reply I wasn't really questioning your putting the image in the infobox appearance wise I don't think it makes much difference . It is better though I think to have the thumbnail indicator Is it possible to have that inside the infobox ?
1	Hi Kathleen It looks OK to me all I did was change the template wording a bit and add parent cats to the stub category . What problem were you having ?
1	There been a slow revert war occurring between url and url over the Katja Kassin article and I've just left a strongly worded suggestion that they hash out their differences in the article talk page . Could you keep an eye on the article for a day or two just to make sure they stop reverting and start discussing ?
1	I would like to first thank you for coding the afd helper app . Secondly is it possible it could be changed to work with other XfDs ?
1	Hello Jeff79 . Would you weigh in on the above linked discussion regarding an edit you made ?
1	Thank you . Was it anything in particular ?
1	On another note I'm going to assume that you were the one who also added ridership data for various LIRR stations am I correct ? If so could you kindly point me towards your source ?
1	Good one for the beginning . Is it possible to paint say red color an area between the null line and the curve below it and blue or green an area between the null line and the curve above it ?
1	Although I have yet to understand what some of your maps mean they are superb ! Have you ever considered professional cartography ?
1	David Sprenkle was at the University of Illinois in 1982 at least part of it while I was there . Were you there too ?
1	I just saw that after I left this message to you . By speech marks do you mean quotation marks ?
1	Jason how do you view your phone call to tlc father&pastor in the light of the Biblical conflict resolution process ? And in the light of the Wikipedian conflict resolution process ?
1	Congrats ! I thought you were going to be away today ?
1	At first I couldn't see it but now that I've taken a closer look I see what you mean . Now I wonder who was the first most decorated PR soldier in WW II ?
1	I'm curious how do you make those beautiful coats of arms ? Do you have a script that generates them from the heraldic descriptions or do you make them by hand ?
1	Thank you for getting to all those WikiProject Canada assessements so quickly ! Question is it useful what I'm doing adding the template even to what I know will be relative low importance articles ?
1	A quick question I'd like your opinion on something . Do you think I should put url GAN on hold or fail it ?
1	Everything about url looks fantastic but going to 2 instead of 30em seems like a major step back . Is there a reason for it ?
1	I'll add that to the others . Will that work ?
1	There seems to have been something wrong with the pages you made on the V8 Supercar Championship Series a glitch with the align tags in the beginning infobox made the text grotesquely overflow the margins . I've trimmed these down mind checking my work ?
1	Hi Leah is it working again ? I had some difficulties with WP in general a couple of days ago and was wondering if your issues had the same origin ?
1	I know there is some discussion at url regarding primary topics so I'm unsure if performing this edit would be an ok move . Thoughts ?
1	Yeah thank you so much . Can anyone do that or only admins ?
1	Heh thanks . Do you know of any scripts that might come in handy ?
1	Hi I've added a question to your RfA . Also could you elaborate on how you will prevent vandalism ?
-1	He returned to the same trolling he was doing years ago . If he really wants to edit in good faith why not insist he make some non controversial edits for a while instead of immediately restarting a two year old edit war ?
1	url is at it again adding in the in the Premiership content you I successfully merged several weeks ago . Could you perhaps also drop a note on his talk page asking him to stop ?
1	url is brand new and may need some attention . I thought you might be just the person who can help get that article at least secured against SPOD attacks ?
1	Furthermore I've heard something about FE trading cards . I know that you know more about it than me so maybe you could write a small passage about it in the media can be renamed and then I can reference it ?
-1	url . I don't know the guy doesn't look very notable but I feel this strange kinship old undervalued metal can you save him ?
1	Thanks was getting worried there for a moment . Have you though of asking Outriggr for a hand with url ?
1	I think this deserves its own article as opposed to being in the centrifugal one . Do you have any good sources that describe how it works ?
1	I hate to roll back 26 edits in a row but I see a lot of good stuff a lot of questionable and non NPOV stuff not much if anything in the way of citation and a ton of misspellings . Can we discuss these edits before imposing them please ?
1	I've made some improvements to url keeping in mind your previous comments about the article . Since you gave its grade before would you like to see it if it could be reassessed ?
1	Sounds good to me . Should we start preparing for it now just in case the GA reviewer notices that something significant is missing ?
1	Hi I hadn't realized that you had made a revert on redirecting this . Could you see my comments on url ?
1	With all due respect that is going to take ages . How can one create a Bot to do all this for me for url url url url and url ?
-1	I'm not sure if you've changed your opinion of the article FAC status but I think you have guided us in a ton of good ideas . Have you changed your opinion ?
1	Hi I am having problems with one of the references you added as it goes to the main page and not to one showing any of the figures on religion . Can you have a look at url ?
1	Those of us who've been here the whole time are pretty incredulous about it also . :) We miss your fine editing style and hope you come back sometime keep looking in on us now and then at least ?
-1	I reverted your changes to the section heads at url because I believe that References when the section contains nothing but book titles and page numbers is better than Notes and that Bibliography is the best alternative to References when that header is already in use . But I'm keen to find out what actually recommended is there room for my preference ?
-1	The fellow is giving me a hard time there . Could you please comment ?
1	Great job . Will it be done by next week ?
1	I was doing some minor editing on this and noticed that the date of death in the intro and infobox don't match . Could you take a look at this and see which is correct ?
1	FYI I found a unit representative I think see url . I directed him to your draft for the military reps would you mind supporting him if you need I am kindof wrapped up in several different things off wiki and on ?
1	Yes but not this week as I have university exams . Perhaps next week or you want this to be a lead up story for Earth Day ?
1	Yes I agree . Would you please make the appropriate change ?
-1	I know url is one what about url ? Shouldn't it also be a primary topic or are there actual rules which discourage practice of all caps ?
-1	It looks like the category functioning works . Can we get an alert to render instead of the default missing parameter nowiki 1 nowiki behaviour ?
-1	Are they here ? Who ?
1	Hi I wanted to ask what do you follow to create redirects on this url ??
1	thank you very much for your patience and for listening . how do you think is the best way to resolve these issues ?
-1	What user list ? The one I linked to ?
-1	I've had a look at it I cannot make the height width of the image any smaller because it will limit the number of towns I can add . Therefore is there any point to adding an atlas to wikipedia ?
1	Thanks . Oh and if you don't mind would you please block the sockmaster ?
-1	On that topic not every DOS game on Wikipedia has a screenshot . Do you plan on taking any yourself ?
-1	url has been promoted to A class . Shouldn't that score ?
1	Can I you take a look at url and url ? Specifically look at the formatting of the general reference is it an acceptable way to present the references ?
1	Hello I noticed you recently did a lot of work on the url page . I was wondering if you know of the origin of the word Nassarius its etymology what is it named after ?
-1	Hey did you ever read over the material I laid out for you content as well as ideas for organization of an article ? Any feedback ?
-1	I've read everything again and I still think it the right decision . What I'm confused about is if you claim that url does not care about capitalisation how do you explain url url and url examples given on the talk page ?
1	Thank you for your kind comment . Do you have a suggestion where the portals should be placed in the article ?
1	Just an FYI I replied at FPOC . How many lists would you prefer ?
-1	Spam filter ? Do you mean your post was reverted ?
1	Nice . What SVG editor did you use ?
-1	Not a whole lot of contrast with the letters now if you've traversed the link . Maybe a green pattern is just not the right base color if we are trying to avoid confusing with WP officialstuff ?
1	Good day . Can look at this report please url ?
1	Following your comments I've improved the article a bit more . Do you think it ready for A class review ?
-1	Do you also consider this alternative view http en.wikipedia.org wiki Holocaust#Holocaust_denial  ? How about this http en.wikipedia.org wiki Denial_of_the_Armenian_Genocide  ?
1	I know this is a bit outside your usual territory but I wonder if you would be interested in helping us get url to FA status in time for the 50th anniversary of the line closure on 10 June 2011 ? A question has also arisen in connection with the proper referencing of a journal article using the sfn template when quoting a journal article say from January 2010 should the correct formulation be nowiki person nowiki or should the month be dropped ?
-1	I will have to hunt out my albums and take a look . Do you mean something like a photographer credit ?
-1	Splash I added the info about his age dispute the user then removed my edits called me a liar and added a whole bunch of other deliberately negative POV edits to the article . What can I do now can they be blocked ?
1	Hi Steph this would be a fine article but its already pretty fleshed out do you have a specific sub topic regarding propaganda films that you'd like to write about ? Have you found some research about propaganda films that you'd like to synthesize ?
-1	Still highly POV . Shall we put pictures of human skeletons from Auschwitz on url ?

-1	I merged the two articles into url . What about the other related articles ?
-1	I supose it would be cool to avoid using same person in different nationality infoboxes for the simple reason that for non involved people may seem confusing .

-1	That still not the original source and after searching through a few pages on Flickr I'm assuming the original is all rights reserved anyway . Can I ask why you believe it is public domain ?
-1	come to think of it this is kind of a really nitpicky question but url does count as current head of the main Matsudaira family right ? Since it only became renamed and all but it still the continuation of the same family ?
-1	It just doesn't make sense to me that we use a manga spelling for one name but a Simmons spelling for another . Can't we just go along with Simmons on this one ?

-1	172 has refused to materially defend his take on NOR in terms of any criteria in url even abrasively deleting a query from a newbie on the subject in his talk page . Is it possible to get some official clarification on the NOR policy before this becomes a precedent ?
-1	Right so the links on your userpage ? And what is the article you want me to check over ?
-1	Your DYK hook for url is missing something . It says Frank Bancroft managed the now defunct Major League Baseball Providence Grays maybe his now defunct Major League Baseball team the Providence Grays ?

-1	I noticed you reverted a US English speller . Shouldn't the section url actually be spelled Tyres for internal consistency ?
-1	Was googling with thoughts of creating url and found link to url it like the 8th hit on google . You planning to move to WP main space soon ?
-1	But the main question was that would it be a bad idea to make more articles about characters orginizations and etc in a book ?
-1	What does OP mean ? Does it mean operator ?
-1	May I also ask how CheckUser became involved in the matter ? To justify such a use of computer records surely someone needs to invoke a due process of some kind for the action to be justified ?
-1	Okay I tagged url a hoax twice but url has pointed out http www.tylershoemakerracing.com . I can't remember exactly what the article said but does it agree with the source ?
-1	Why can't it just be fixed ? There are other tables on wikipedia that aren't working properly perhaps nobody noticed ?
